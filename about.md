## Hey there!

My name is RÃ©my Moll. I currently live and study in Zurich, Switzerland. Please have a look at my curriculum vitae:

<object width="100%" height="700" type="application/pdf" data="/public/cv.pdf?#zoom=80&scrollbar=0&toolbar=0&navpanes=0">
    <p>It seems like the pdf won't load. Try downloading it anyway: <a href="/public/cv.pdf">cv.pdf</a></p>
</object>

## Get in touch

The easiest would be to write me an email under: [{{ site.author.email }}](mailto:{{ site.author.email }})

Or have a look at my GitHub profile: [{{ site.author.github }}]({{ site.author.github }})
