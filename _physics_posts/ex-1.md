Remember the maxwell equations? We'd like to use them in order to deduce the wave equation (for some potential $\phi$):

$$\left( \Delta - \dfrac{1}{c^2} \dfrac{\partial^n}{\partial t^n} \right) \phi = 0$$

(with $c^2 = (\mu_0 \epsilon_0)^{-1}$).

A big help will be the **Lorentz gauge-condition**, but let's first recall the full set of maxwell equations in vacuum:
$$\nabla E = 0$$
$$\nabla \times B = \dfrac{\partial E}{\partial t}$$
$$\dfrac{\nabla}{\Omega}$$
