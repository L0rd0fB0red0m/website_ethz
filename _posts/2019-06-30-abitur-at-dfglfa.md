title: Das deutsch-franz√∂sische Abitur
---

I was student at the [DFG-LFA](https://dfglfa.net/dfg) and passed my baccaleaureate there. It was a rich experience and being able to follow the courses in multiple language proved to be a precious advantage.

At the same time I turned out to be the main organisator of the extra-curricular events related to the graduation. In Germany/France these include a ball, a yearbook, a few cultural events and sponsorships to support all of the previous. Effectively I was responsible for a wide variety of activities:
* opening a bank account and balancing the finances
* creating designs
* managing more than 100 pages of content by many writers
* printing and distribution of leaflets, invitations, yearbooks
* orchestraing the main event (the ball) and organising all the necessary: catering, music, entertainment, seating ...

Needless to say it was a tough year, but I keep very fond memories of it. Funnily enough, working on these projects provided an excellent way to blow off steam and allowed to experiment in different fields than the one told a school. I got my first experiences in finances, print-design, event-managing and many more. Some of them were more tedious than others, but all were immensly instructive. This has encouraged me to imply myself in more actions like these and I look forward to do more of it once I'm at university.
