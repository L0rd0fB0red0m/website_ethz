title: The first year at ETH
---

So I decided to study physics at this university and it turns out there is a whole lot more to learn than I thought. At least I've discovered so many fascinating topics to work on and I'll have enough to do for years to come.

It has been a year of condensed knowledge and I fear that I haven't been able to process it all. I do however remain amazed by this field and I'm really excited to do more in that direction. Hopefully I'll be able to get involved in activities alongside classes.

One of my biggest projects this year was the redaction of my lecture-notes with latex. In the end I only finished theses for one course: calculus. I'm really proud to see how well they turned out and I'd love to share them: They're on GitHub, right [here](https://github.com/L0rd0fB0red0m/analysis). Hopefully they will be able to help someone. I have learned a lot while writing them down.
