  Hey there! This page runs the Hyde theme, running on Jekyll, running on GitHub pages. That's kind of nested, but works quite well for me.

To learn more and get started, have a look at [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). It's quite fascinating what you can do on GitHub.


If you want to get in touch, talk about, the content, the setup, or anything else, head over to [About me](/about) and write me!
