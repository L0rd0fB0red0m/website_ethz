  Hey there! This page runs the Hyde theme, running on Jekyll, compiled by GitHub actions. That's kind of nested, but works quite well for me.
</p>

To learn more and get started, have a look at [GitHub actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). It's quite fascinating what you can do on GitHub. Here's the current status of compilation:
[![Compile the website and push to ETHZ ftp](https://github.com/L0rd0fB0red0m/website_ethz/actions/workflows/upload.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/L0rd0fB0red0m/website_ethz/actions/workflows/upload.yml)


If you want to get in touch, talk about the content, the setup, or anything else, head over to [About me]({{ site.baseurl }}/about) and write me!
